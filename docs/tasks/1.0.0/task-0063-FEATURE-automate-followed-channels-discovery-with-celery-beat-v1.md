## Prompt (Agent Mode)

Now I want to tackle an issue we have updating the status of the celery task in the Followed Youtube Channel card component.

We have the problem that when we send the task to the background, we are updating the Followed Youtube Channel card component by having a icon spinning
when we send the task to search for new videos to the background.

The problem that i have identified is that the card correctly shows the status "queued" right away, but it last for a very long time, then it directly
jumpts to updated and the date.

According to the workflow of the specs of this feature, we should have the status "queued" when the user clicks the "search for new videos" button, and
the celery task is queued, but not when the celery task actually starts its job of searching for new videos (when the task is being handled by a
Celery worker). When we are actually searching for new videos, the status should be "searching" and not "queued". We need to show "searching" when the
celery task is being processed which is what actually should take time.

According to the documentation in @docs/documentation/TECHNICAL-ANALYSIS-FEATURE-follow-channels-architecture.md the state machine for the celery task,
we might have a problem since it has a state downloading, not searching.

Note from the documentation that the `celery_task_status` states are as follows: `PENDING`, `STARTED`, `PROGRESS`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RETRY`. We
might have a problem that maybe we are using the wrong state, we might be using
`youtube_videos` state (**States:** `pending_review`, `reviewed`, `queued`, `downloading`, `episode_created`, `discarded`) instead of
`celery_task_status` state.

### Testing Information

I tested the flow with a full test and i was able to reproduce the problem. I got the following results:

1. The user clicks the "search for new videos" button.
2. The system creates a celery task and updates the status of the celery task in the UI to "queued".
3. The celery task starts doing its jobbut the UI is still showing "queued".
4. The celery task is finnished successfully and the status of the celery task in the UI is still showing "queued".
5. The UI is updated to show "completed"
6. Then after i refresh the page, the status is changed to reflect "updated" and the date of the last update (eg: updated: 30/11/2025 10:40)

A few more notes that i investigated of a full test of the flow:

1. In image 1 we can see that right after we click on the button to search for new videos, a toast message is shown saying "RSS check task queued
   successfully" and the status is updated to "queued" and the icon starts spinning.
2. In image 2 we can see the case that after the celery task has found some new videos and marked them as "pending review", the satus still shows
   "queued" and the icon keeps spinning. In image 3 we see that when we checked the activity page we saw that the action of finding new videos has two
   events: first event type is "Search started" and the second and most recent event is "Search completed".
3. In image 4 we see that after a while, the status is changed to reflect "completed" and, then after i refreshed the page, we see in image 5 that the
   status was finally changed to reflect "updated" and the date of the last update (updated: 30/11/2025 10:40).
